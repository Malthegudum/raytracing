# Raytracing
This is a simple 3d-rendering python program using raytracing. The program renders 5 random spheres with different positions, sizes, colors and reflectivity along with a checkered floor and a sky. It was made in the fall of 2021.

Example:

It is still far from perfect, it doesn't have antialiasing, the sky doesn't render properly and it can only render spheres.
